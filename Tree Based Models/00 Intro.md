Classification problems are common in all domains and tree based models are very effective solutions to these problems.
This course is all about tree based models, from simple decision trees, to complex ensemble learning techniques, and more.

Overview: 
- Recognize classification problems
- Understand how decision trees are used to solve classification problems
- Understand how machine learning can be used to build decision trees :: Tree based Models


Applications:
Gender Detection      - Male, Female <br/>
Weather Forecasting   - Cloudy, Sunny, Rainy <br/>
Quant Trading         - Up day, Down day <br/>
Fraud Detection       - Fraud, Not fraud <br/>

We are given a problem instance
A name <br/>
A time of Day<br/>
A trading day<br/>
A transaction<br/>


A Name (Problem Instance) ----> Classifier  -----> Male/Female (Label)

Step 1: Define a set of rules

The tree represents a series of choicec i.e decisions and hence THE DECISION TREE. <br/>
Thus, whenever you have a classificatio problem, you can always try Tree based algoritms <br/>

The order in which we look at the attributes is important

- Decision Tree Learning Algorithms (Build a single decision tree)
- Ensemble Learning Algorithms      (Build multiple decision trees and combine their results)
