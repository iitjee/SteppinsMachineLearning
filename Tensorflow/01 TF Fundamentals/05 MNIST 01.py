'''Yo! Let's start Helloworld of TF = MNIST! xD '''


The actual code for this tutorial is very short, and all the interesting stuff happens in just three lines. However, it is 
very important to understand the ideas behind it: both how TensorFlow works and the core machine learning concepts. Because of 
this, we are going to very carefully work through the code.
