Logistic regression, or logit regression, or logit model is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical.
dependent variable = randome variable = y
catogerical = variable should take one of the values from a known set (like enums)


The assumption of normality is just the supposition that the underlying random variable of interest is distributed normally, or approximately so. 
Intuitively, normality may be understood as the result of the sum of a large number of independent random events.
